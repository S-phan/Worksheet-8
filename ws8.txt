This  [17;1Hcauses an emotional reaction to the truth, and that makes it almost impossible ff[18;1Hor some people to take. For example, most people have been around the Internet ll[19;1Hong enough at this point to have seen an Urban Legend or two. When you point outt[20;1H that someone has forwarded you an Urban Legend, there is an underlying realizatt[21;1Hion by the sender that they have just been fooled. They become embarrassed, defee[22;1Hnsive, and sometimes deny the truth by trying to back up the story with allegatii[23;1Hons that the story was verified by other sources. There comes a time when you haa[24;1Hve to put aside your emotional reaction to a situation and just analyze the factt[25;1Hs.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that one of the reviewers seems to basee[26;1H his assertion for Mike's innocence on a personal conversation that he had with  [27;1HMike.

I first purchased this book in 1972 and have re-read it many, maa[4;1Hny times.  Though I certainly do not agree with everything Commander Rockwell wrr[5;1Hote, many of his observations and conclusions, though dated by time, still appeaa[6;1Hr to be valid even today.<br /><br />His concerns about the power and influence  [7;1Hof organized and entrenched Zionism and the dangers implicit in this power and ii[8;1Hnfluence ring bitterly true after events such as 9/11 and the invasion of Afganii[9;1Hstan and Iraq where American foreign policy has been increasingly hijacked by prr[10;1Ho-Israel 'neocons'.  In addition, his warnings about the violence and degeneracyy[11;1H of African-American culture and behaviour can be verified by simply turning on  [12;1Hyour radio and listening to the savagery, sexuality and baseness of so-called 'rr[13;1Hap' and 'hiphop' music as well as by examining the barbarity and sexual promiscuu[14;1Hity still found in the inner cities of Detroit, Washington, Los Angeles and New  [15;1HYork.<br /><br />The genius of Commander Rockwell, who gave his life for his cauu[16;1Hse and his people, is clearly evident in his warnings and prognostications for tt[17;1Hhe America of the future.

In conjunction with the British journalist and former Times corress[20;1Hpondent J.O.P Bland, he had authored two best selling books about the Chinese Roo[21;1Hyal Court at the Forbidden City, Peking (now Beijing).  Backhouse, by the time oo[22;1Hf his death, had lived in China for nearly 40 years.  The high esteem in which hh[23;1He had been held by students and scholars of Chinese history collapsed upon publii[24;1Hcation of this book by Hugh Trevor-Roper (HTR).  Trevor-Roper of course is the ee[25;1Hsteemed British historian and author of the classic \\"The Last Days of Hitler\\\[26;1H".  The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" is the first full biography of one of history's gg[27;1Hreatest scam artists, Sir Edmund Backhouse.  The pinnacle of Backhouse's achievee[28;1Hments, the publication of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" in 1910, was fou[28;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                             [m[29;1H[K[29;63H4,865-930      0%[12;50H[?25h[?25l[29;53Hn[12;50H[29;1H/verified[29;53H[K[29;1H[1;28r[1;1H[22M[1;29r[23;76H[1;1H fact, Seagrave is particularly scathing and rightly so.  As a direct consequencc[2;1He of Backhouse's forgery of a diary supposedly by a high Manchu court official,  [3;1Hand subsequent book publications based upon the diary, popular history regards tt[4;1Hhe Dowager Empress as an evil, scheming, and manipulative woman, who went as farr[5;1H as having her own son murdered to maintain her grip on the regency of China.    [6;1H<br /> <br />The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" gives a much fuller account of the life  [7;1Hof Backhouse, and fills in more detail about the numerous frauds that Backhouse  [8;1Htried pull off.  Not only was Bland as co-author of \\"China under the Empress DD[9;1Howager\\" a victim (Bland believed until his death that the diary could not havee[10;1H been a forgery) of Backhouse's fraudulent activities, but also G. Morrison, thee[11;1H renown Times Correspondent.  Even Oxford University and the British Government  [12;1Hwere taken in as HTR gleefully relates.  It is amazing that Backhouse got away ww[13;1Hith what he did without the greater world being aware of it, but HTR shows the rr[14;1Header how he did so (Backhouse's victim's embarrassment was one reason).  In parr[15;1Ht, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a detective story as HTR pulls the threads of tt[16;1Hhis tale together, sorts fact from the many fictions.  It is well written, and oo[17;1Hnly in the final chapters does HTR delve into the literary pornography for whichh[18;1H Backhouse is now famous for, and HTR does so with taste, sparing the reader thee[19;1H graphic details (Seagrave doesn't spare though).  Trevor-Roper relied on a numbb[20;1Her of sources, which in the main is the private correspondence of Bland and Morrr[21;1Hison.  The author also had access to the archives of the Foreign Office and of oo[22;1Hne of Backhouse's former employers.  And of course, HTR uses Backhouse's own wrii[23;1Htings to point out historical contradictions and fabrications which can be veriff[24;1Hied with certainty.    <br /> <br />If there is a quibble with the book, it is tt[25;1Hhat HTR doesn't dwell on the historical consequences of Backhouse's frauds and hh[26;1How it contributes to a long and widely held misconception of the final days of tt[27;1Hhe Chinese Royal Court, the role which Tzu His played in it.
